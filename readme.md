# MACAD23 - Cloud based Data Management
## Session 04

Due to recent security updates in github pages and compute, it's not possible to run compute from a github pages site without a custom domain. ([Thanks James](https://iaac-macad.slack.com/team/U044RJ2RFLM) 😉)

For that reason, we've created a custom domain for you guys to put your project:

**http://www.data-mgmt.com/**

### Instructions to collaborate in this repostory

5. update this readme.md (below) in the root with your example


you should be able to run your compute project in `http://www.datamgmt.com/{YourFolder}`
- note that the `http`  in that address is really important. `https` wont work with compute
